In JAVA multiple inheritance is not supported
for example:-

class A{
int n = 6;
}
class B{
int n = 10;
}
class c extends A, B{
System.out.println(n);//here the problem occurs which n its going to print
}

that's why multiple inheritance is not supported in JAVA

====================================================================================================

In JAVA hybrid Inheritance is also not supported
Hybrid Inheritance means have both the single and multiple Inheritance
As we know that multiple inheritance is not allowed in JAVA, hybrid contains multiple inheritance
    hence, hybrid inheritance is also not allowed in JAVA

for example:

class A{
int n;
}
class B extends A{
}
class C extends A{
}
class D extends B, C{
}

// here the problem occurs hence, it is also not allowed in JAVA
